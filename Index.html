            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>If you are unwilling to risk the unusual, you will have to settle for the ordinary. There is one thing
                that 99% of failures and successful people have in commone: they all hate doing the same things. the
                difference is successful people do them anymore. </p>

                tedious- which is why so few people ever master anything. thr public sees only the thriil of the
                accomplished task; they have no comception of the tortous preliminary self-trainin that was necessary to
                conquer fear.</p>
